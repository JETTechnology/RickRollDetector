## What is the current latest stable release?

v1.0 is the official stable version and is pending review from the Google Extensions store. However, v1.1 is now near completion and will be sent for review whenever we have a chance to do so.

## Is this extensions published on google chrome extensions store?

It is currently not published. However, it is currently pending review from the google team, and version 1.0 will be up whenever it is approved. 

## Is the code in this github repo v1.0?

No, all of the code in the `stable` and `shipment-ready-1.1` branch are code that is ready for the v1.1 release. Once v1.1 is released, `stable` branch will stay with the v1.1 code, `shipment-ready-1.1` branch will be deleted, and work towards v1.2(this could possibly become the v2.0 update) will be in the experimental build.

## How do I install it?

stable: the latest release on chrome store with minimal bugs
shipment-ready-x: release ready for publish to the chrome store
experimental: WIP to the next version

1. Go to the branch you want to install! and then Download the code by pressing on the green button `Code` at the home repo page and then press on `Download ZIP`.
2. Extract the folder you have just downloaded.
3. Go into the extracted folder, where you can see manifest.json.
4. Copy the route to the folder.
5. Go to chrome://extensions in your google chrome browser.
6. Enable Develper Mode on the top right corner
7. Click on `Load unpacked` and then paste the route you copied before in the explorer, then press select
8. Tada! It is installed to your browser manually

## I see error in the chrome://extensions extension profile!

In most cases, that is perfectly normal and won't affect your usage of the extension. However, if it is something that affects the use of the extensions, submit a bug report by using the extension menu(click on the extension icon), or [click here](https://forms.gle/wXihhprFn6PpxbGq8).
